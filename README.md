# rememberingDad
#### *Author: Kevin Soo*

My father passed away on November 17, 2016. He wrote for Malaysia's largest English newspaper. This is a text analysis of his writings.

The repository contains the following scripts:
* `scrape_articles.R` scrapes all my dad's writings from [The Star](http://www.thestar.com.my/authors/?q=%22Soo+Ewe+Jin%22) website
* `word_frequencies.R` pre-processes his writings into a corpus and does preliminary analyses of word frequencies
* `word_clusters.R` computes distances between words and looks for neighboring words
* `topic_modeling.R` builds a topic model of his writings

All these are used to produce [*Predictably Comforting: The Writings of Soo Ewe Jin*](https://kevinsoo.github.io/BetweenTwoWaves/posts/predictably-comforting-the-writings-of-soo-ewe-jin.html), a blog post reporting these analyses.

*This work is dedicated to Soo Ewe Jin (1959-2016).*
